Refine and professionally polish my resume website. The goal is to elevate the visual design, interaction behavior, and user experience across both desktop and mobile views — without changing the existing structure or stack.

This site is built to represent me as a Technical Operations Coordinator. It must feel confident, visually balanced, and credible to hiring managers. Focus on clean design logic, hierarchy, subtle motion, and personalization.

🧩 Hero Section
- Center-align content block visually on both desktop and mobile
- Add an initials-based avatar or minimalist personal branding element
- Include a short tagline below my name that reflects my domain (e.g., “Tech delivery, systems, and support coordination”)
- Increase font size and weight of name/title using scalable `clamp()` logic

🎯 Skill Stack
- Replace raw lists with visually styled skill chips or badges
- Group skills into clear categories: “Frontend”, “Backend”, “Cloud & Tools”, “Data & ML”
- Add hover tooltip or color accent per category for quick scanability

📂 Projects & Demonstrations
- Wrap each entry in a card-style layout with:
  - Box shadow or soft border
  - Clear spacing between title, stack, and skills used
  - Project type label (e.g. "ML Demo", "Mini App", "Frontend Project")
- Apply scroll-triggered fade-in or slide-up animations using modern motion standards
- Add hover scale effect or background highlight for interactivity

📱 Mobile Experience
- Add consistent padding (`1.5rem`) around content
- Improve vertical spacing between sections
- Center-align Hero and CTA buttons
- Add a floating “Back to Top” button for long pages

🎨 Theme System Upgrade
- Theme toggle should also affect:
  - Font pairing (e.g., serif vs sans-serif)
  - Button color and border-radius
  - Background tone and shadow levels
- Include smooth CSS transitions when switching themes

🎥 Interaction Enhancements
- Add hover/focus styles to all buttons and links
- Add subtle motion to section transitions: `fade-in`, `slide-in`, or `scale-in`
- Use scroll observer logic to animate sections on entry (with staggered timing)

📄 Resume CTA
- Make the resume download button a primary CTA block
- Style it with strong visual emphasis and center it in its own section or fixed footer

🧠 General UI Upgrades
- Use consistent max-width for content containers (`max-width: 1280px`)
- Ensure headings use a distinct font or heavier weight than paragraph text
- Use spacing tokens (e.g., 2rem, 3rem) to create vertical rhythm between sections
- Add optional footer section with soft divider and links (LinkedIn, GitHub, email)

⚠️ Do not rewrite the entire app or structure. Improve only the design system, component presentation, interactivity, theme dynamics, and resume action visibility.

🎯 Final goal: the site should look and feel like a complete digital resume — professionally designed, motion-aware, responsive, and personalized for hiring teams to trust and explore.
